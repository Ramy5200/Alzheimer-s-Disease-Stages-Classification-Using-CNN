# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Stages-Classification-Using-CNN
This project focuses on using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for classifying stages of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from MRI images. The model employs DenseNet-169, a CNN architecture, to classify four AD stages
